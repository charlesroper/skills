# cbeams git commit messages

This repository hosts the `cbeams-git-commit-messages` skill, which describes how to draft clear,
consistent commit messages following Chris Beams’ seven rules. It is meant for tooling that assists
with writing concise, imperative subjects plus optional bodies that explain what changed and why.

Use this skill as your reference whenever you need a reminder on how to write readable git history
messages.
